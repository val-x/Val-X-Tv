# Coolify Service Variables (SERVICE_FQDN_*)

## About SERVICE_FQDN_* Variables

Coolify automatically injects `SERVICE_FQDN_*`, `SERVICE_NAME_*`, and `SERVICE_URL_*` environment variables for service discovery. These are **NOT defined in our docker-compose.yml** - they're generated by Coolify based on service names and domains configured in the Coolify UI.

## Our Application Doesn't Use These Variables

Our Val-X API application uses:
- `MINIO_ENDPOINT` (not `SERVICE_FQDN_MINIO`)
- `JELLYFIN_URL` (not `SERVICE_FQDN_JELLYFIN`)

These Coolify-generated variables are **safe to ignore** - they don't affect our application.

## If You Want to Remove Them

If Coolify shows an error: *"Cannot delete environment variable 'SERVICE_FQDN_JELLYFIN'. Please remove it from the Docker Compose file first."*

### Option 1: Keep Them (Recommended)
These variables are harmless and don't interfere with our application. Simply leave them in Coolify - they're automatically managed by Coolify.

### Option 2: Remove from Coolify UI
If you really want to remove them:
1. They're not in our `docker-compose.yml` file
2. Coolify is generating them automatically
3. You may need to remove them from Coolify's service configuration UI, not the environment variables page
4. Or contact Coolify support if the error persists

### Option 3: Explicitly Exclude (If Supported)
Some versions of Coolify allow excluding auto-generated variables. Check Coolify documentation for your version.

## What We Actually Need

Our application requires these environment variables (set in Coolify UI → Environment Variables):

**Required:**
- `MINIO_ENDPOINT=http://minio:9000`
- `MINIO_ACCESS_KEY=valxadmin`
- `MINIO_SECRET_KEY=valxsecret`
- `JWT_SECRET=supersecretkey`
- `PORT=8080`
- `CORS_ORIGIN=https://*.val-x.com,https://val-x.com`
- `JELLYFIN_URL=https://play.val-x.com`

**Optional:**
- `JWT_EXPIRES_IN=7d`
- `MAX_UPLOAD_SIZE=10737418240`
- `RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=60000`
- `RATE_LIMIT_MAX=100`
- `FFMPEG_PATH=ffmpeg`

See `COOLIFY-ENV-SETUP.md` for complete setup guide.

## Summary

- ✅ `SERVICE_FQDN_*` variables are **Coolify-generated** (not in our code)
- ✅ They're **safe to ignore** - our app doesn't use them
- ✅ Focus on setting the variables listed above in `COOLIFY-ENV-SETUP.md`
- ✅ If you can't delete them, that's fine - they won't cause issues
